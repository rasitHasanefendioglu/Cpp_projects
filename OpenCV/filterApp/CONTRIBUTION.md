# CONTRIBUTION Guidelines
This document explains the requirements on contributions and the recommended steps. Also, integration steps are defined with rules and examples.

## New Features
Before contribution, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a new issue in the repository and assign it to one maintainer.

## Bug Fixes
Bug and security fixes are always welcome and take the highest priority.

## Branching and commit messages
For all implementations, `feature/filterApp/<implementation_topic>` naming convention is used by creating new branch from current default branch of the repository.

For example: PR is related to refactoring an item of logging mechanism: Use `feature/filterApp/refactor-logging-mechanism`  

For every commit a message/header is mandatory and description is strongly advised. Every commit message should follow this [guideline](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) with addition to change of location in parenthesis after commit type. As an example `fix(filterApp): change-kernel-size-to-fix-segmentation-fault`.
